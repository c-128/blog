    <h1>Having fun with Minecraft fonts</h1>

    <p>
      So I was browsing YouTube and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9bjbL1dYAE">video</a> got recommended to me. It was about messing with Minecraft fonts in resource packs<br />
      The idea is that Minecraft has a lot of unused Unicode charachters in thier vanilla font, and we can make use of them because since 1.13 you can create our own fonts.
      And here I was messing with it and I decided to share some of the results with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first idea was to make rank tags using that idea, and I think it turned out alright.
      <img src="./img/002-ranks.png" /><br />
      This can be extended far beyond these examples, you can add icons and of course more ranks.<br />
      <a href="./files/002-resource-pack-ranks.zip"><button class="btn">Download example resource pack</button></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      I also had the idea to create chat HUDs.<br />
      <img src="./img/002-chat-hud.png" /><br />
      In this example, it shows the Enemny HP, a guess on how long your food will last, and how close you are to getting to a new Combat level.<br />
      Of course Minecraft chat messages dissapear after some time, so you need to resend the message every 9 seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      So now for the last part I'll tell you how you can do it yourself. 
      You can either watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9bjbL1dYAE">tutorial video</a> or follow my guide.<br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a basic Minecraft Resource pack. You need the assets folder, which contains a minecrfat folder, which should contain a font and a textures folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now in the font foler, create a file called default.json.
          <div class="codeblock">
            <div class="header">
              <div class="lang">JSON</div>
              <div class="name">default.json</div>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
              {<br/>
              &ensp;"providers": [<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; {<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "type": "bitmap",<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "file": "minecraft:font/example.png",<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "ascent": 8,<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "height": 9,<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "chars": [<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; "\uEff1"<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; ]<br/>
              &ensp; &ensp; }<br/>
              &ensp;]<br/>
              }
            </div>
          </div>
          The type property is just to show that its a image, ttf is also a valid option, altough I don't know how to use it.<br/>
          The file property is just the location to your image, in this case it would be located at /assets/minecraft/textures/example.png<br/>
          The ascent property is how much you want to move it on the Y-axis.<br/>
          The hight property just shows how high your font is.<br />
          And the chars array shows which characters should be shown for that font.
        </li>
        <li>
          And now lastly, put your image into /assets/minecraft/textures/example.png. Try to make the image height the same as the height in default.json.
        </li>
      </ol>
